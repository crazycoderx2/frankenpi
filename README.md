# frankenpi

This is an experimental project to connect Raspberry Pi with the help of cheap Cyclone IV board to 8-bit ISA bus to act as multiple different devices.

Currently RP can act as hard disk using an image and the PC can boot with the help of hacked VGABIOS. This way one doesn't need any other cards in the BUS except VGA adapter and the frankenpi.
Adlib emulation is also working through the Pi.
Some preliminary work to support PCB through Sound Blaster emulations and optical SPDIF has also been done, but these are not yet working.
